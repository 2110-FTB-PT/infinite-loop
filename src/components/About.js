          Say hello to the team that can always figure it out. Are we the best?
          Nope. But we can guarantee we aren't the worst. Team Mid has been
          building web applications since October 2021. With their combined
          mediocre programming skills, they can surprisingly create exceptional
          user experiences.

              If Yeonju isn't intensely programming, she's doing high intensity
              interval training. She also enjoys creating content, you can catch
              some of her work on YouTube.

              swimming with sharks in Hawaii, so no matter what she faces in the
              real world or in developing an app, she is always as cool as a
              cucumber.
